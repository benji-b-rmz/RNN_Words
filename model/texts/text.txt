A young student of Zen was going to the market to buy vegetables for the monastery where he was studying . On the way he met a student from another monastery . “ Where are you going ? " asked the first student . “ Wherever my legs take me , " replied the other . The first student pondered over the answer as he was sure it had some deep significance . When he returned to the monastery , he reported the conversation to his teacher , who said : “ You should have asked him what he would do if he had no legs . " The next day the student was thrilled to see the same boy coming towards him . “ Where are you going ? " he asked and without waiting for a reply continued , “ Wherever your legs take you , I suppose . Well , let me ask you " “ You’re mistaken , " interrupted the other boy . “ Today I’m going wherever the wind blows . " This answer so confused the first boy that he could not think of anything to say . When he reported the matter to his teacher , the old man said : “ You should have asked him what he would do if there were no wind . " Some days later the student saw the boy in the market again and rushed to confront him , confident that this time he would have the last word . “ Where are you going ? " he asked . “ Wherever your legs take you or wherever the wind blows ? Well , let me ask you " “ No , no , " interrupted the boy . “ Today I’m going to buy vegetables . "
